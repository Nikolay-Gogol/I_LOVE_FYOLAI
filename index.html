  <h1>Appearance</h1>
  <a>Fyodor is a tall and slim young man. He is described to have a thin pale face and long messy hair of a purplish black, somewhat disheveled, that reaches his shoulders. His eyes are sharp and of a dark purple color, giving him a tired look.His attire is formal. He wears what appears to be a long-sleeved buttoned white shirt, with light purple cuffs and outlines, and white pants. It is accompanied by a long black coat with a few yellow buttons, reaching Fyodorâ€™s knees, along with white fur. He also wears a white ushanka hat, and long boots of a maroon color.</a>

  <h1>Appearance</h1>
  <a class="w">Gogol has white layered, sharp hair swept to the left side of his face. However, as short as it seems, he also has a long braid of hair that often rests on his right shoulder. A scar is slit vertically down his left eye. Compared to his left eye, his right eye appears vacant, bearing no highlights in it. Over his right eye appears to be a card-styled mask or eye patch. Gogol's attire is just as eccentric as his personality and closely resembles that of a circus ringmaster. He wears a mostly black jacket, the right side being solid black, black-and-white striped trousers, a shirt with a ruffled, round collar akin to a loose elaborate turtleneck, and dark gloves. He completes the outfit with a top hat with a diamond pattern.</a>
